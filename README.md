## 🛒 E-commerce Dataset Analysis – Part 1: Data Cleaning & Preparation

Welcome! This project showcases my ability to clean, transform, and prepare real-world e-commerce data for analysis. It’s the first phase of a multi-part project designed to simulate the data workflow often required in business analytics and decision-making environments.

### 📌 Project Purpose

The aim of this notebook is to demonstrate my capabilities in:

- Preparing a clean, structured dataset for business analysis
- Writing clear, well-documented, and reproducible code

This process mirrors the typical **data wrangling** stage that precedes business intelligence and predictive modeling in the real world.
